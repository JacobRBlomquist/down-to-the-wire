<p>I'm a software engineer driven by an insatiable curiosity about how things *really* work-from the networking protocols that power the internet to the philosophical questions that shape our understanding of consciousness.<p>

<p>Currently, I architect cloud infrastructure for IoT systems at scale, working with millions of connected devices and billions of messages monthly. My work spans the full stack of distributed systems: designing event-driven architectures, optimizing databases for cost and performance, and building real-time communication systems that connect physical devices to mobile applications.</p>

<p>But my passion extends far beyond the day job. I read RFCs for fun and once implemented part of the MQTT 3.1 specification from scratch just to understand it better. I write speculative fiction exploring consciousness and technology, make soap as a chemistry experiment, and create art through programming. I'm fascinated by existential horror games like SOMA and equally at home discussing the elegant engineering decisions behind TCP/IP's victory in the Protocol Wars as I am analyzing the philosophical implications of collective consciousness.</p>

<p>What drives me is that most people-even engineers-take incredible complexity for granted. The internet represents one of humanity's greatest engineering achievements, built on decades of thoughtful protocol design and pragmatic trade-offs. Yet few understand the *why* behind these decisions, the battles between competing standards, or how those choices still influence every distributed system we build today.</p>

<p>I love sharing this knowledge through writing and mentoring, helping others discover the immense engineering and thought that goes into the systems we use every day. Whether I'm explaining why TCP/IP beat OSI in the Protocol Wars, designing IoT networks that blend short-range and long-range communication, or exploring how alien technology might challenge our understanding of individual identity, I'm always asking: what are the deeper principles at work here?</p>

<p>I believe the best engineers are also philosophers, historians, and storytellers. As philosophers, we question the assumptions behind our architectures and consider the deeper implications of our design choices. As historians, we learn from past technical decisions. As storytellers, we translate complex technical concepts into narratives that help others understand not just what we're building, but why it matters and how it connects to the larger human story of innovation and discovery.</p>

<p>When I'm not optimizing cloud architectures or implementing protocols from scratch, you'll find me exploring new technologies, nerding out, or diving deep into whatever fascinating rabbit hole has captured my curiosity this week.</p>
